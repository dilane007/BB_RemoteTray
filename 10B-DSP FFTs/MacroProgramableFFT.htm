            <P>Not all DSP architectures are right for certain 
            algorithms-several DSP algorithms have regular data flow structures 
            and use just a small set of basic operations, which are repetitively 
            executed. Take, for example, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter 
            bank. Its operation set is limited to the radix-2 butterfly, but 
            butterfly operations of a higher radix number make the FFT 
            computation more efficient. With some supplementary simple 
            operations, even sophisticated FFT-based filter bank algorithms like 
            the weighted overlap add (Wola) can be performed. Gain coefficients 
            can be applied on the processed data in the frequency 
            domain.</P></EXTRACT>
            <P>It's inefficient to use general-purpose DSPs for such algorithms 
            because they do not take advantage of the algorithm's regularity to 
            save program code or to shorten the execution time. General-purpose 
            DSPs execute each operation individually, so they need a detailed 
            description that includes the internal macro-operation sequence and 
            the parameter addresses. For each operation,they have to read all 
            that data together with control instructions. This reduces execution 
            time and increases power consumption.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, a hardwired processor works much faster 
            because it doesn't lose cycles for the control instructions. But 
            flexibility is low because of the hardwired control and data path 
            units.</P>
            <P>A new DSP architecture offers a solution that is flexible because 
            it is macroprogrammable and is as efficient as hardwired processors. 
            It's especially efficient for well-organized algorithms like 
            FFTs.</P>
            <P>Three functions</P>
            <P>The data flow of a 16-complex-point FFT spectrum analyzer with a 
            windowing and time-folding feature has three major functions: 
            analysis, gain application and synthesis. The analysis function has 
            three passes: The first contains multiply-accumulate (MAC) 
            operations and is used for windowing and time folding, and the next 
            two contain radix-4 butterfly operations. The gain application 
            function has only one pass with multiplication operations. The last 
            function corresponds to the first one, but the pass order and the 
            operations are reversed.</P>
            <P>The structuring of the FFT spectrum analyzer data flow scheme has 
            several nice characteristics that simplify an implementation. First, 
            each pass processes all data words. Second, each pass contains 2n 
            operations (n=1, 2, 3 . . .). Finally, the address generation 
            becomes very easy if the operations of a pass are processed in the 
            correct order. These characteristics are conserved in each 
            configuration of an algorithm family, but the detailed algorithm 
            parameters like the number of passes or the address generation 
            function depend on the configuration.</P>
            <P>Dual advantage</P>
            <P>An implementation of an algorithm that is structured in that 
            fashion profits in two ways. On the one hand, it is helped by the 
            fact that a pass contains only one operation type; on the other, it 
            gains from the simplified address generation using bit-reversing 
            functions. Because a pass contains just one operation type it isn't 
            necessary to code each operation of the pass individually. It is 
            enough to define the operation type once the pass begins. In that 
            way the program code becomes smaller and the number of program 
            memory accesses decreases. The same simplifications and advantages 
            are possible if a parameter address follows a simple rule. But the 
            rule has to be included in the program code instead of in a 
            parameter word for each operation. For FFT-based algorithms the 
            address rules can easily be coded because the rules are mostly 
            limited to bit-reversing functions.</P>
            <P>Our DSP architecture has been developed for tiny devices drawing 
            ultralow power where FFT-based algorithms are used in a flexible 
            way-for example, hearing aids. The following design constraints, 
            which have to be satisfied by the DSP architecture, are mainly 
            defined by the destination applications:</P>
            <P>- Minimal hardware size (DSP size and memory requests)</P>
            <P>- Minimal power consumption</P>
            <P>- High flexibility</P>
            <P>- Low supply voltage (down to 0.9 volts)</P>
            <P>- The DSP must be able to treat the algorithms at a clock 
            frequency of only 1 MHz because of the low-voltage-related speed 
            reduction of CMOS gates.</P>
            <P>The choice of DSP architecture is mainly influenced by the 
            knowledge that all operations are the same inside a pass and that 
            the addresses for data and coefficient follow well-defined rules. 
            Once all parameters for a pass, including the operation type and the 
            address rules, are defined, those parameters are sufficient to 
            process an entire pass.</P>
            <P>These requirements have been transformed in a basic DSP 
            structure. The head of the DSP is the control unit. It defines at 
            the start of each pass the pass parameters, which are transferred 
            together with the processing or cycle state via the configuration 
            bus to the functional units. The last ones contain address 
            generators, data interfaces and the data path and are responsible 
            for data processing during the pass. When a pass is completely 
            processed, the control unit defines the configuration for the next 
            pass and restarts the functional units. This continues until the 
            last pass of the function has been processed. The signal start 
            activates the DSP for the treatment of one function that is defined 
            by function number. The end of the processing time is indicated by 
            function end.</P>
            <P>Data path and address generators are the most important 
            functional units. But other units may also be realized as 
            functional, among them interface units, control units for circular 
            memories (FIFO) and units for block floating-point arithmetic. In 
            the address generator, a first block creates an initial address 
            value by selecting the relevant counter state bits. Then, this value 
            is transformed by a bit-reversing function before the unused most 
            significant bits are cleared by masking. The combination of the 
            received value with an offset value may be interesting in one of the 
            following cases: realization of circular memories (FIFO emulation), 
            reduction of a 360-sine/cosine table or mirroring of symmetric 
            window functions.</P>
            <P>The data path unit contains a control part and the real data 
            path. Depending on the requirements, the last one may contain one or 
            more arithmetic units. The organization of the arithmetic units in a 
            first array of multipliers and two arrays of adders is suitable for 
            the treatment of radix-4 butterflies. Depending on the requirements 
            and the possibility of a parallel access of the data and 
            coefficients, each array may contain one or more arithmetic units. 
            Input registers prevent multiple memory access for the same data 
            word and intermediate registers and output registers create a data 
            pipeline. The control part is usually very small and generates the 
            control signals for the MUX, registers and arithmetic units.</P>
            <P>The presented macroprogrammable architecture has been used for 
            the implementation of a low-voltage (0.9-V) FFT processor for 
            ultralow-power applications. The macroprogrammability offers a 
            solution for more than 400 different FFT-based Wola filter bank 
            configurations.</P>
            <P>To improve processing quality and interface flexibility, some 
            supplementary functional units have been introduced. A block 
            floating-point unit improves the quantification noise and an input- 
            and output-FIFO controller simplifies interfacing to 
            analog-to-digital and digital to-analog converters. Four address 
            generators are used in this application. The data path unit contains 
            two MAC units and four adders. It can process complex operations 
            like radix-2 and radix-4 butterflies.</P>
            <P>The processor requires approximately 19,000 gate equivalents. It 
            has been integrated on 0.35- and 0.18-micron technology. For the 
            0.18-micron integration, depending on the Wola configuration, the 
            power consumption is 60 microamps to 220 microamps at 1.2 V. A 
            typical 16-complex-point Wola configuration as it is often used in 
            hearing aids consumes about 110 microamps at only 1.2 V.</P>
            <P>Because of the smart macroprogrammable approach, the size of the 
            controller part and the address generators could be limited to 10.9 
            percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in comparison with the entire 
            processor size without losing throughput and system flexibility.</P>
            <P>The presented DSP architecture is an ideal solution for 
            algorithms with well-organized data flow graphs. It is flexible 
            because it is macroprogrammable and is as efficient as hardwired 
            processors. Because the control units, address generators and data 
            path unit of the presented DSP architecture work in parallel, no 
            cycle is lost for control and address operations: the data path unit 
            can work with its maximum throughput. The macrocode concept cuts the 
            control and address generation overhead of the DSP system. This 
            results in low power consumption and small size.</P>
